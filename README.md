# Student Management System (Python)

## Overview
The Student Management System is a simple Python-based application that helps manage student records efficiently.  
It allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete student information from a local file or database.  
This project demonstrates Python fundamentals such as file handling, data structures, and user interaction through a command-line interface (CLI).
